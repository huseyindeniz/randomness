# Randomness

Randomness is a difficult problem to solve in computer science. Due to its deterministic nature, it is even more difficult in blockchain projects.

In fact, it's no exaggeration to say that 100% secure randomness is impossible on the blockchain.

However, "almost secure" randomness could be usefull in most cases. This projects goal is having "almost secure" randomness on the blockchain.

## How It Works

Some nice diagrams and explanations here.

## Integration

Short hardhat example here.

### Contract Addresses

- Avalanche Network: 0x...
- Avalanche Fuji C-Chain: 0x...

## Disclaimer

At the time of writing, there is no known successfull attack to this algorithm. But as mentioned before, blockchain is a deterministic environment. Please use this source for non-critical operations with your own risk.
